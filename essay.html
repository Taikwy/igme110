                Video games nowadays can be based in all sorts of settings, although few can top
                the fascinating whalepunk aesthetic of the Dishonored franchise. The coasts of the
                Kingdom of Dunwall and the Island of Serkonos aren’t the only thing unique about
                Dishonored; from the art style, to the music, down to the very core design of the game
                Dishonored tries to break the mold. The franchise is no stranger to extremely
                memorable levels, yet few are as easily recognizable as the Clockwork Mansion. In terms
                of both narrative and gameplay significance, the Clockwork Mansion stands out as one
                of the most iconic levels in Dishonored 2. As a product of the success of the reveal trailer
                for Dishonored 2, I was completely hooked. The sprawling clockwork mechanisms and
                fluid movement of the trailer captivated me, and I was more than eager to see how well
                Arkane Studios had transferred their CG trailer into the game. At first the level seemed
                to be just as beautiful and flawless as the trailer promised. After just a bit of gameplay
                however, my hopes had been slashed and I realized the Clockwork Mansion had failed to
                meet any of my expectations at all. What should have been a shining jewel amidst the
                other incredible levels in Dishonored 2, the Clockwork Mansion succeeds only at being
                one of the most disappointing levels I’ve ever played in a video game. For a mansion
                made of clockwork with such potential for level design and gameplay, the Clockwork
                Wang 2
                Mansion stands as the worst level in Dishonored 2 and a prime example of biting off far
                more than you can chew.
